# Heresy Score — v0.10.1

Mobile-first, spoiler-safe reading soundtrack companion for *The Horus Heresy*.

## Current reading state

- Active book: *The Flight of the Eisenstein*
- Spoiler clearance: through Chapter IXII
- Chapter IX: READY
- Chapters X–XI: STAGED
- Local progress key is still `heresy-score-v01` so existing reading history survives upgrades.

## Main features

- PWA installable on mobile.
- Spotify PKCE connection with automatic private chapter playlist sync.
- Spotify playback-device state detection, with the reading timer held at 00:00 when Spotify has no active device.
- In-app reading session controls:
  - Play / Resume
  - Pause session
  - Previous / Next track
  - protected Final Cue jump
- Reading timer pauses together with the Spotify session.
- Scene-first soundtrack curation: emotional/scene function is prioritized before total playlist duration.
- Pace-aware chapter targeting uses the reader's ~1.5 min/page baseline plus recent actual chapter times; duration is calibrated per chapter rather than with a global buffer.
- Leitmotif layer tracks recurring musical identities without forcing the same cue into every appearance.
- Expanded composer palette can pull from additional official Warhammer soundtracks when a scene needs a different emotional color.
- Chapter-specific score metadata supports:
  - curated target duration
  - optional reserve tracks only where the chapter structure allows them
  - protected final cue
  - READY / STAGED / SEALED states
- Field Logs with:
  - reading time
  - duration / opening / peak feedback
  - notes
  - per-track Fits / Doesn't Fit marks
  - Copy Debrief
  - local/cloud sync state
- Compact chapter reading window plus full archive toggle.
- Book archive view.
- Spoiler-gated Dramatis Personae.
- Progressive spoiler-safe character summaries that expand only when the relevant chapter clearance is reached.
- Progressive ACTIVE / DECEASED status tracking based only on the current reading clearance.
- Broken/unreliable external character visuals fall back to an intentional REDACTED record instead of a broken image.
- Voidcraft & Theatre Archive with clearance-gated records and explicit Official / Reconstruction / REDACTED provenance.
- Private Archive Recovery Code for restoring the same cloud log identity after reinstalling or moving devices.
- Safe character visuals when a period-appropriate source is available.
- Imperial-style REDACTED dossiers when a safe visual is not available.
- Dedicated adaptive-safe PWA icon generated from the repository Aquila asset.

## Spotify

Spotify uses Authorization Code with PKCE. The public Client ID is configured in the app; no Client Secret is stored in the frontend.

The app maintains one private active playlist and replaces its contents with the score for the current chapter rather than creating a new playlist for every chapter.

## Cloud logs

Cloud sync is active. A reproducible Supabase schema is included at:

`supabase/schema.sql`

The frontend already supports:
- pushing individual chapter logs,
- mirroring all local logs,
- pulling logs back to a device,
- per-install sync tokens,
- local-first fallback.

The Supabase backend is provisioned in São Paulo (`sa-east-1`), the schema is applied, RLS is enabled, and the PWA is preconfigured with the project URL and publishable key. Existing local logs are mirrored automatically on app load unless cloud sync was explicitly disabled. The archive recovery code can be copied to another installation to recover the same log identity.

## Versioning / maintenance

UI, soundtrack logic, reading-state behavior and integrations are tracked in `CHANGELOG.md`.

Service-worker cache versions are bumped whenever the installed PWA must receive a new shell/assets revision.
